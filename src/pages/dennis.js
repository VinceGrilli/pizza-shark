                  Our third (and final!) location opened on the charming stretch of 6A known as Dennis Village in August
                  of 2023. A scaled down version of our Harwich store, we offer our full menu for takeout, as well as
                  snacks, beverages and Pizza Shark merchandise. Take a pint of Giffordâ€™s for the road! Located minutes
                  from Mayflower and Corporation beaches, this area is a bustling stretch of the historic district and we
                  are surrounded by an incredible number of small local businesses. The building was formerly occupied
                  by Showtime Pizza and we are thrilled to continue the tradition of great pizza in the Village. The Dennis
                  location is open 7 days a week, year round, from 11am until 9pm.
